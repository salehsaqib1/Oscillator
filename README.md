# Oscillator
Assignment 6

Problem Statement

The free vibration response of an undamped oscillator with a single degree of freedom
is given by:

y(t) = y(o)*cos(wt) + v(o)*sin(wt)/w

where t is time in seconds, m is the mass and k is the stiffness of the system. The
displacement at time t is y(t) and the velocity is v(t). The natural frequency of the system
is defined as 𝑤 = √𝑘/𝑚.

Write a Matlab script that will compute and plot the displacement vs time as well as the
velocity vs time for the time interval from 0 to 10 seconds. Assume the mass m=1 and
the stiffness, k=10. The initial displacement and velocity are y(0)=1 and v(0)=10.
In order to superimpose the two plots, you can use the “hold” command. Use help to
find out how it works.
Make sure the two plots use different colours.
Make sure you give the graph a title and appropriate labels for the axes.
You must hand in files with
1- The Matlab script that you write.
2- The graph of your results.
